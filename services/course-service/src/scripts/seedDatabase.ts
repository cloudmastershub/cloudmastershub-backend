/**
 * DATABASE SEEDING DISABLED - NO MOCK DATA POLICY
 * 
 * CloudMastersHub follows a strict "No Mock Data" policy to ensure production-ready quality.
 * 
 * All course data must be created through the dashboard interface:
 * - Visit: /instructor/courses/create
 * - Use the course creation workflow for real courses
 * - This ensures proper data validation and business logic
 * 
 * Why seeding is disabled:
 * - Eliminates confusion between mock and real data
 * - Ensures all features work with production data
 * - Provides authentic testing and development experience
 * - Prevents deployment of placeholder content
