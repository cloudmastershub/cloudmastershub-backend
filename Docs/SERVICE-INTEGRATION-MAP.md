## üìà Performance & Scaling Considerations

### High-Traffic Service Pairs
1. **API Gateway ‚Üî Course Management**: Primary user-facing interactions
2. **Course Management ‚Üî Content Delivery**: Video streaming and multimedia
3. **Analytics ‚Üî All Services**: Real-time event processing
4. **Lab Service ‚Üî Cloud Providers**: Resource-intensive operations

### Caching Strategy
- **L1 Cache**: Service-level Redis for frequently accessed data
- **L2 Cache**: CDN for static content and video assets  
- **L3 Cache**: Database query result caching

### Load Balancing
- **API Gateway**: Weighted round-robin with health checks
- **Database**: Read replicas with connection pooling
- **Kafka**: Partitioned topics for parallel processing

---

## üöÄ Development & Testing Strategy

### Mock Service Dependencies
During development, each service can operate with:
- **Database**: Local containers or test databases
- **External APIs**: Mock servers with realistic response data
- **Message Queues**: Local Kafka/Redis instances

### Integration Testing Approach
1. **Contract Testing**: Pact contracts between service pairs
2. **End-to-End Testing**: Critical user journeys across services
3. **Chaos Testing**: Service failure scenarios and recovery
4. **Performance Testing**: Load testing of high-traffic service pairs
